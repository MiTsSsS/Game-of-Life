# Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of John Conway's "Game of Life".   
  
"The Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input."
  
# How to use
This project requires C++20 and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
  
[How to setup SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)
  
# I have everything setup, now what?
Run the code, enter the size of your grid and the number of generations, and watch it do its magic!
